# ChitAnalysis
This Programm is developed to automate the process of reading the scores of a tournament participant.
A CSV file will be created with the scores so it is easy to import them into [Apollon](https://www.bogenfax.de/apollon/).

## Requirements
- Unix-like OS
- Python2
- OpenCV
- Tesseract
- other python modules listet as imports on top of Main.py

## How to run
I developed this in Pycharm so it should be fairly straight forward to get it to run in this IDE
